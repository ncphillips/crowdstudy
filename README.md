# CrowdStudy
In March 2015 I will be starting a new project with Scott Bateman in the study of crowd work.

This repository will contain all code written for this project. 

The server will be written using either Node.js or, it's recent fork, IO.js. Express JS will be used to make some things
a little easier. I intend to build this server from the ground up. It is not meant to be a overwhelmingly robust system,
it just needs to get the job done.

MongoDB will be the backend. It has much flexibility compared to an RDB, which seems fitting to this sort of project.

I will use the React library to help create the GUIs needed.
