# CrowdStudy
Starting in March 2015, the UPEI HCI Lab will be conducting a number of 
experiments related to crowd work. In order to track data gathered from 
these experiments, we have created CrowdStudy. This application for serving
files, and collecting results for each experiment.

The server is written in Javascript using the expressjs framwork. It is
being run by io.js, a fork of Node.js which uses Chrome v8 engine and
supports ES6. 

Data is stored in a Mongo database. 

The React library to help create the GUIs needed.
